# **Software Engineering and Project Management (SEPM) Practical Report**  
### **Title:** Implementation of COCOMO Model for Courier Management System (CMS)  

---

## **1. AIM**  
To study and apply the **COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)** for estimating **cost, effort, and time** required for developing a **Courier Management System (CMS)**.  

---

## **2. THEORY**  

### **2.1 What is the COCOMO Model?**  
The **COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)** is an **algorithmic software cost estimation** model developed by **Barry Boehm** in 1981. It helps predict **effort (person-months), time (months), and cost ($) required** for software development based on **lines of code (LOC).**  

### **2.2 Types of COCOMO Models**  

| **Model Type**     | **Description** | **Usage** |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Basic COCOMO** | Estimates cost based on **size (LOC only)**. | Used for rough cost estimation. |
| **Intermediate COCOMO** | Considers **size + 15 cost drivers** (e.g., complexity, experience). | More accurate than Basic COCOMO. |
| **Detailed COCOMO** | Includes **subsystems analysis** and team experience. | Used for large, complex projects. |

---

## **3. OBJECTIVES**  
✔ To estimate the **effort (PM), time (T), and cost** for CMS.  
✔ To apply **Basic COCOMO Model** for CMS estimation.  
✔ To compare results for **Organic, Semi-Detached, and Embedded** models.  

---

## **4. COCOMO FORMULAS**  

### **4.1 Basic COCOMO Formula**
The effort required is calculated as:  

\[
\text{Effort} (PM) = a(KLOC)^b
\]

\[
\text{Time} (T) = c(\text{Effort})^d
\]

Where:  
- **KLOC** = Estimated **thousands of lines of code**.  
- **a, b, c, d** = Constants based on project type.

### **4.2 COCOMO Model Categories & Constants**  

| **Project Type** | **a**  | **b**  | **c**  | **d**  | **Example** |
|----------------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| **Organic** (Simple) | 2.4  | 1.05 | 2.5  | 0.38 | Small teams, simple CMS |
| **Semi-Detached** (Medium) | 3.0  | 1.12 | 2.5  | 0.35 | Moderate complexity CMS |
| **Embedded** (Complex) | 3.6  | 1.20 | 2.5  | 0.32 | Large, high-security CMS |

---

## **5. COCOMO CALCULATIONS FOR CMS**  

### **5.1 Estimating Lines of Code for CMS**
- **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, React)** = **15 KLOC**  
- **Backend (Python/Java, APIs, Authentication, Tracking)** = **25 KLOC**  
- **Database (SQL Queries, Transactions, Security)** = **10 KLOC**  
- **Total LOC = 15K + 25K + 10K = 50K LOC**  
- **KLOC = 50K / 1000 = 50**  

---

### **5.2 Applying COCOMO Model**

#### **For Organic Model (Small CMS)**
\[
\text{Effort} = 2.4 (50)^{1.05} = 136.6 \text{ PM}
\]
\[
\text{Time} = 2.5 (136.6)^{0.38} = 14.2 \text{ months}
\]

#### **For Semi-Detached Model (Medium CMS)**
\[
\text{Effort} = 3.0 (50)^{1.12} = 235.2 \text{ PM}
\]
\[
\text{Time} = 2.5 (235.2)^{0.35} = 17.5 \text{ months}
\]

#### **For Embedded Model (Large CMS)**
\[
\text{Effort} = 3.6 (50)^{1.20} = 402.3 \text{ PM}
\]
\[
\text{Time} = 2.5 (402.3)^{0.32} = 21.3 \text{ months}
\]

## **6. RESULT ANALYSIS**

| **Model** | **Effort (PM)** | **Time (Months)** | **Team Size** (Effort/Time) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Organic** | 136.6 | 14.2 | 10 Developers |
| **Semi-Detached** | 235.2 | 17.5 | 13 Developers |
| **Embedded** | 402.3 | 21.3 | 19 Developers |

---

## **7. CONCLUSION**  
- The **effort and time** required for the **Courier Management System** depend on the **complexity and team size**.  
- The **organic model** is suitable for **small CMS**, while **semi-detached or embedded models** are ideal for **large-scale systems**.  
- **More complex projects require more resources** and **longer development time**.  

---

## **8. FUTURE SCOPE**  
✔ Apply **Intermediate COCOMO** for more accurate estimation.  
✔ Use **AI-based cost estimation tools** for better predictions.  
✔ Implement **Agile development to reduce effort and time**.

# **Practical on Project Scheduling Using Gantt Chart**  

## **Aim:**  
To create a project schedule using a Gantt chart by identifying tasks, assigning resources, and setting up timelines for efficient project management.  

## **Objective:**  
1. Identify and list the tasks involved in a project.  
2. Allocate resources to each task.  
3. Develop a schedule and visualize it using a Gantt chart.  
4. Monitor dependencies and optimize project execution.

## **Step 1: Define the Project & Identify Tasks**  
For this practical, we will consider the **Courier Management System** project. The key tasks involved are:  

| **Task ID** | **Task Name**                 | **Duration** | **Dependencies** |
|------------|--------------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| T1         | Requirement Gathering         | 4 days     | -               |
| T2         | System Design                 | 5 days     | T1              |
| T3         | Database Design               | 3 days     | T2              |
| T4         | Backend Development           | 7 days     | T3              |
| T5         | Frontend Development          | 6 days     | T3              |
| T6         | Integration & Testing         | 5 days     | T4, T5          |
| T7         | Deployment                    | 3 days     | T6              |
| T8         | Final Review & Submission     | 2 days     | T7              |

## **Step 2: Assign Resources**  
Each task requires specific resources. The allocation is as follows:  

| **Resource ID** | **Resource Name**        | **Assigned Task(s)** |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| R1            | Project Manager       | T1, T7, T8      |
| R2            | System Analyst        | T1, T2          |
| R3            | Database Engineer     | T3              |
| R4            | Backend Developer     | T4              |
| R5            | Frontend Developer    | T5              |
| R6            | Tester                | T6              |

## **Step 3: Develop a Gantt Chart**  
A **Gantt Chart** is used to visually represent the project schedule. Below is an example of how it would look:  

| **Task Name**            | **Week 1** | **Week 2** | **Week 3** | **Week 4** |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Requirement Gathering   | ████      |           |           |           |
| System Design          |           | █████     |           |           |
| Database Design        |           | ███       |           |           |
| Backend Development    |           |           | ███████   |           |
| Frontend Development   |           |           | █████     |           |
| Integration & Testing  |           |           |           | █████     |
| Deployment            |           |           |           | ███       |
| Final Review          |           |           |           | ██        |

*(█ represents work duration for each task.)*

## **Step 4: Execution & Monitoring**  
- If a task is delayed, dependencies need to be adjusted accordingly in the Gantt chart.  
- Parallel tasks (e.g., backend and frontend development) help optimize time.  
- Regular tracking ensures project deadlines are met.  

---

## **Conclusion:**  
By using a **Gantt chart**, we effectively scheduled the **Courier Management System** project, assigned tasks to appropriate resources, and established a structured timeline for execution. This method ensures clear project tracking, avoids bottlenecks, and improves project efficiency.

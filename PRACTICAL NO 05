# **Software Engineering and Project Management (SEPM) Practical Report**  
### **Title:** Modeling Data Flow Diagram (DFD) & Control Flow Diagram (CFD) for Courier Management System  

---

## **1. AIM**  
The aim of this practical is to study and model:  
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD):** To represent the flow of data in the **Courier Management System (CMS)**.  
- **Control Flow Diagram (CFD):** To illustrate the **process flow and decision-making** in the system.  

This helps in understanding the **functional and control aspects** of CMS for better system design.  

---

## **2. THEORY**  

### **2.1 What is a Data Flow Diagram (DFD)?**  
A **DFD** is a graphical representation that shows:  
✔ **Processes** that transform data.  
✔ **Data stores** where information is kept.  
✔ **External entities** interacting with the system.  
✔ **Data flow** between components.  

### **2.2 Levels of DFD**  
| **Level**  | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **Level 0 (Context Diagram)** | High-level overview of the system. |
| **Level 1** | Expands Level 0, showing main processes. |
| **Level 2+** | Further breakdown of complex processes. |

---

### **2.3 What is a Control Flow Diagram (CFD)?**  
A **CFD** represents the **flow of control** in the system using **conditions, loops, and decision-making logic**.  
✔ **Nodes** represent operations or conditions.  
✔ **Arrows** indicate the flow of execution.  

**CFD is useful for:**  
✔ Analyzing **decision-making** in the system.  
✔ Identifying **logical flow and process execution order**.  

---

## **3. OBJECTIVES**  
✔ To create a **DFD for CMS** showing data flow between users, system, and processes.  
✔ To design a **CFD for CMS** illustrating logical control flow.  
✔ To understand **process interactions and system behavior**.

## **4. CASE STUDY: COURIER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**  

### **4.1 Actors in CMS**  
✔ **Customer** – Places courier orders, tracks parcels, makes payments.  
✔ **Courier Staff** – Collects parcels, updates delivery status.  
✔ **Admin** – Manages orders, users, and generates reports.  
✔ **Payment Gateway** – Handles transactions.

## **5. DATA FLOW DIAGRAM (DFD) FOR CMS**  

### **5.1 Level 0 - Context Diagram (High-Level View)**  
- **External Entities:** Customer, Courier Staff, Admin, Payment Gateway.  
- **Processes:** Order Processing, Parcel Tracking, Payment Processing.  
- **Data Stores:** Customer Database, Order Database, Tracking Database.  

```
  +------------------------+
  |     Customer           |
  |------------------------|
  |  - Places Order        |
  |  - Tracks Parcel       |
  |  - Makes Payment       |
  +------------------------+
          │
          ▼
+---------------------------+          +---------------------------+
|   Courier Management      |--------->|    Admin (Manages Orders)  |
|        System             |          +---------------------------+
|---------------------------|
|  1. Process Order         |
|  2. Update Parcel Status  |
|  3. Payment Processing    |
+---------------------------+
          │
          ▼
 +------------------------+
 |  Courier Staff         |
 |------------------------|
 | - Collects Parcels     |
 | - Updates Status       |
 +------------------------+
```

### **5.2 Level 1 DFD - Breaking Down Processes**  

#### **1. Order Processing**  
✔ Customer provides parcel details → System **stores order** in database.  
✔ Admin **verifies** order and assigns **courier staff**.  

#### **2. Parcel Tracking**  
✔ Customer **enters tracking ID** → System retrieves **status from tracking DB**.  

#### **3. Payment Processing**  
✔ Customer **selects payment method** → Payment Gateway **processes transaction**.  
✔ **On success:** Order is confirmed.  

```
      +-------------+             +--------------+
      |  Customer   |------------>|  Order System|
      +-------------+             +--------------+
               |                        |
               ▼                        ▼
      +------------------+     +------------------+
      |  Admin           |---->|  Courier Staff   |
      +------------------+     +------------------+
```

## **6. CONTROL FLOW DIAGRAM (CFD) FOR CMS**  

### **6.1 Understanding Control Flow in CMS**  
✔ **Decisions**: Accepting orders, verifying payments, tracking parcels.  
✔ **Loops**: Checking parcel status, updating order database.  
✔ **Conditional Branching**: If **payment fails**, request retry.  

---

### **6.2 CFD Representation of Order Processing**  

1️⃣ Customer logs in → **Checks account**  
2️⃣ If **new order**, enter parcel details → **Submit request**  
3️⃣ Admin **verifies order**  
   - If **approved** → Assign **courier staff**  
   - If **rejected** → Notify **customer**  
4️⃣ Courier **collects parcel**  
5️⃣ If **successful delivery**, update status  
6️⃣ If **failed**, notify admin for reattempt
